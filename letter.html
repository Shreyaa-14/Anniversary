    <h1>My dear UPTIGHT GUY 💗</h1>
    <p>
      From the moment you came into my life, everything felt lighter and brighter.
      All hese years with you have been full of warmth, laughter, comfort,
      and love that I never knew I needed.
      <br>
      You showed me what kindness truly means and what unconditional love looks like.
      Thank you for choosing me every day, for loving me even when I’m difficult,
      and for being my safe place. I am so grateful for every moment we share together and for every laughter we share.
      <br>
      Touchwood to us for coming so far,<br>
      I promise to love you ever and forever.
      <br>
      Forever yours <br>
      Siya ❤️
